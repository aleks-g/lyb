    """Compute the near-optimal feasible space of `n`, cut off at eps.

    Implements an algorithm which iteratively solves the LP associated
    with `n` using different objective functions in order to 'probe'
    the near-optimal feasible space and find an approximate explicit
    description.

    We consider a projection of the entire feasible space of `n` onto
    the lower-dimensional space spanned by a selection of decision
    variables (or sums of decision variables). Specifically, the
    projection is the span of the vectors given by the `basis`
    argument. The elements of this collections are assumed to be
    linear expressions generated by `pypsa.linopt.linexpr`.

    The near-optimal feasible space is defined as the feasible space
    of `n` with the additional constraint 'c.x <= (1 + `eps`) * OPT',
    where c is the objective function and OPT the optimal value.

    A dictionary of PyPSA-Eur configuration (containing in particular
    the `solving` section) is assumed to be attached to `n` as
    `n.config`.

    The return value is a collection of points given in the basis
    specified by `basis`. The convex hull of these points is an
    approximation of the near-optimal feasible space of `n`.

    Various convergence criteria for the algorithm can be chosen. The
    first is convergence by volume; when the volume in successive
    iterations does not increase more than `conv_eps` the algorithm is
    terminated. The second method terminates when the distance between
    the Chebyshev centers of successive iterations drops below
    `conv_eps` (Note the different role and unit of `conv_eps` for
    different convergence methods.). The algorithm terminates after
    `conv_iter` iterations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : pypsa.Network
    basis : OrderedDict
        A basis on which to project the feasible space of `n`. The
        keys being the decision variables with values given in the
        format produced by `pypsa.linopt.linexpr`.
    mga_space : pd.DataFrame
        Points generated from the MGA iterations to compute the
        initial convex hull approximation.
    obj_bound : float
        Upper bound for costs in near-optimality constraint.
    conv_method : str
        Convergence method. Can be 'volume' or 'centre'.
    direction method : str
        Method for choosing directions. Can be one of 'facets',
        'random-uniform', 'random-lhc', 'maximal-centre' or
        'maximal-centre-then-facets'.
    direction_angle_sep : float
        Initial angle threshold for direction generation. Depending on
        `direction` in the configuration, this threshold can decrease
        automatically down to `angle_tolerance`.
    conv_eps : float
        Convergence threshold in percent.
    conv_iter : int
        Number of iterations for which the convergence criterion must
        be below `conv_eps` for the algorithm to terminate.
    max_iter : int
        The maximum number of iterations after which the algorithm is
        termined regardless of convergence.
    debug_dir : str
        Directory where the debug files (networks, volume, centre,
        radius, probed directions) should be saved.
    cache_dir : str
        Directory where the cache files (config, points, probed
        directions) should be saved. If points and probed directions
        from previous runs with the same configuration exist, these
        are being used.
    num_parallel_solvers : int
        The number of parallel processes to use.
    qhull_options : str
        Options for qhull, e.g. for numerical stability or to avoid
        certain degeneracies.
    angle_tolerance : float
        Minimal angle threshold for filtering.

    Returns
    -------
    Collection[np.array]
        A collection of points in the basis of `basis`, whose
        convex hull is an approximation of the near-optimal feasible
        space of the given model.
